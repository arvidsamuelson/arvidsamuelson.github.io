## Resources
A friend and mentor of mine (whom I owe a great deal to), [Dr. Tal Waltzer](https://www.twaltzer.com)  has provided plenty of resources for undergraduates across numerous topics, such as communicating professionally, opportunities to get involved in research, tips for graduate school and beyond, and plenty of example materials, on their website [here](https://www.twaltzer.com/students). I strongly encoruage you to check it out.
