In most cases, people, even wicked people, are far more naive and simple-hearted than one generally assumes. And so are we. --- <cite>Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov</cite>

Welcome to my website!
------
I'm a PhD Student in the [Developmental Psychology Lab](https://dmplab.cornell.edu/) working with [Audun Dahl](https://psychology.cornell.edu/audun-dahl). I am supported in part by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

My research interests involve moral development and social cognition, with a focus on how children and adults understand moral disagreement. I am especially interested in trying to figure out when we see each other as reasonable, even while we may disagree.

## A small biography
I was born in Stockholm, Sweden, and I lived in England as a child before moving to the United States. I received my B.A. in Psychology from [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu). 

Outside of research, I enjoy working out, listening to music, and taking photos (that I at least think look nice). See more below!
